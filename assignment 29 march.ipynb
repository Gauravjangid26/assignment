    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the objective function, which is proportional to the absolute magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty term, also known as L1 regularization, encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net regression, in that it introduces a different type of penalty on the coefficients, resulting in a more sparse model with some features excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. This means that Lasso Regression can effectively identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model, resulting in a more interpretable and potentially simpler model. This can be particularly useful in high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features, where selecting a subset of relevant features can improve model interpretability and generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in a similar way to those of a standard linear regression model. The coefficients represent the estimated effect or contribution of each feature on the predicted outcome variable. However, due to the L1 penalty, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features are excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model involves considering the magnitude and sign of the coefficients. The magnitude of the coefficient represents the strength of the effect, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger effects. The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the effect, with positive values indicating a positive relationship and negative values indicating a negative relationship between the feature and the outcome variable. Features with non-zero coefficients are considered to be selected by the Lasso Regression model and are assumed to have a non-negligible contribution to the predicted outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted as λ (lambda), which controls the strength of the L1 penalty. A larger value of λ results in a stronger penalty, driving more coefficients to exactly zero, and thus resulting in a sparser model with fewer selected features. Conversely, a smaller value of λ results in a weaker penalty, allowing more coefficients to have non-zero values, and potentially resulting in a model with more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the regularization parameter λ in Lasso Regression affects the balance between model complexity and model fit to the data. A larger value of λ increases the amount of regularization, which can help reduce overfitting but may also result in underfitting if the penalty is too strong. A smaller value of λ reduces the amount of regularization, which can lead to better fit to the training data but may also result in overfitting if the penalty is too weak. The optimal value of λ depends on the specific data and problem at hand, and it may require tuning to find the best value for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique and is primarily used for linear regression problems where the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable is assumed to be linear. However, Lasso Regression can be used in combination with non-linear transformation of the predictor variables to model non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to using Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems is to apply non-linear transformations, such as polynomial or interaction terms, to the predictor variables before fitting the Lasso Regression model. For example, if the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable is expected to be quadratic, cubic, or higher-order, the predictor variables can be transformed accordingly, and then Lasso Regression can be applied to the transformed variables. However, it's important to note that interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model with non-linear transformations can be more complex compared to linear regression, as the effects of the predictor variables may not be easily interpretable in terms of simple linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are both regularization techniques used in linear regression to address the issue of overfitting and improve model generalization performance. However, they differ in the type of penalty they apply to the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression is in the type of regularization or penalty applied to the coefficients. Ridge Regression uses an L2 penalty, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, to the objective function. This penalty term encourages smaller but non-zero values for all the coefficients, resulting in a model with reduced magnitude of coefficients but without exactly driving any coefficient to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Lasso Regression uses an L1 penalty, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute magnitude of the coefficients, to the objective function. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, resulting in a model with a subset of selected features and potentially a simpler model with some features excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to instability in the coefficient estimates and difficulties in interpreting their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, with its L1 penalty, has a tendency to automatically select one of the correlated features and drive the other(s) to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. This can help in handling multicollinearity as it selects only one of the correlated features and excludes the others from the model, thereby reducing their impact on the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that Lasso Regression may not always be able to perfectly handle multicollinearity, especially when the correlations among the features are very high. In such cases, Ridge Regression, which uses an L2 penalty and does not drive coefficients to exactly zero, may be more appropriate as it can shrink the coefficients of correlated features towards zero without excluding them entirely from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Choosing the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ in Lasso Regression typically involves a process called hyperparameter tuning, where different values of λ are tested, and the best value is selected based on model performance on a validation set or through other optimization techniques. Some common approaches to choose the optimal value of λ in Lasso Regression include:\n",
