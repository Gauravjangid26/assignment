    "Ridge regression is a statistical method used for linear regression that is similar to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but with an additional penalty term added to the objective function. Like lasso regression, ridge regression is a type of regularization technique that is used to mitigate the risk of overfitting in linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between ridge regression and OLS regression is the penalty term that is added to the objective function. In ridge regression, the penalty term is a quadratic function of the coefficients, multiplied by a hyperparameter called the regularization strength or lambda (λ). This penalty term is added to the sum of squared residuals (SSR) term in the OLS objective function, and the model seeks to minimize the combined value of the SSR and the penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the objective function of ridge regression can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "minimize: Σ(yi - β0 - Σ(Xij * βj))^2 + λ * Σ(βj^2)\n",

    "yi is the observed value of the response variable for the i-th observation\n",

    "βj is the coefficient of the j-th predictor variable\n",
    "λ is the regularization strength hyperparameter\n",
    "Compared to OLS regression, ridge regression has several differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty term: Ridge regression adds a penalty term that is a quadratic function of the coefficients, while OLS regression does not have any penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinkage of coefficients: The penalty term in ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but does not usually drive any of the coefficients to exactly zero. This means that all predictor variables are retained in the model, albeit with reduced magnitudes. In contrast, OLS regression does not shrink the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity handling: Ridge regression is particularly effective in handling multicollinearity, which is a situation where predictor variables are highly correlated. Ridge regression can effectively reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the model by shrinking the coefficients of correlated variables towards each other, while OLS regression may suffer from unstable estimates in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model complexity: Ridge regression introduces a tuning parameter (λ) that controls the trade-off between model complexity and the goodness of fit. A larger value of λ results in a simpler model with smaller coefficients, while a smaller value of λ allows for a more complex model with larger coefficients. In OLS regression, there is no tuning parameter to control the complexity of the model."

The data is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained on a subset of the data and tested on a different subset.

    " Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection. Ridge Regression introduces a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, which can shrink the coefficients of less important predictor variables towards zero.

Larger values of lambda result in stronger shrinkage of coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing the impact of less important features in the model.

    "Ridge Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity, which is a situation where two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, multicollinearity can cause unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates, leading to inflated standard errors and difficulties in interpreting the importance of individual predictor variables. However, Ridge Regression introduces a penalty term that can help in mitigating multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictor variables towards zero. This reduces the sensitivity of the Ridge Regression model to multicollinearity, and the resulting coefficient estimates are more stable and reliable compared to OLS regression"
