    "Q1. The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in the nature of the categorical variables being encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, also known as nominal encoding, assigns a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. It is suitable when the categories have no inherent order or hierarchy. For example, if we have a variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" label encoding would assign numerical labels like 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy. It assigns numerical labels to categories in a way that preserves the order information. For example, if we have a variable \"Size\" with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" ordinal encoding would assign numerical labels like 0, 1, and 2, respectively, reflecting the order of sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the nature of the variable and the relationship between its categories. If there is a clear ordering or hierarchy among the categories, ordinal encoding should be used to preserve that information. If the categories are unordered or have no natural hierarchy, label encoding is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that combines the target variable's information with ordinal encoding. It assigns numerical labels to the categories of a categorical variable based on their relationship with the target variable's mean or other aggregated statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a machine learning project, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a strong correlation or dependency between a categorical variable and the target variable. By encoding the categories based on their impact on the target variable, it provides valuable information for the machine learning algorithm to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset for predicting customer churn. One of the categorical variables is \"Contract Type,\" which can have values like \"Month-to-Month,\" \"One Year,\" and \"Two Year.\" By encoding these categories based on their average churn rate, we can create an ordinal representation that captures the likelihood of churn associated with each contract type. This information can then be used by the machine learning model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two random variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps identify whether there is a positive or negative linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = Σ((X - μX) * (Y - μY)) / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X and Y are the random variables, μX and μY are their respective means, and n is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates they move in opposite directions. A covariance of zero suggests no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Here's an example of performing label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library for the given dataset with categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium, large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic).\n",
