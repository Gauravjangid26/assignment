The model will estimate the parameters (slope and intercept) of the line that best fits the data and predicts the height based on the weight.\n",

    "Let's say we have a dataset of 100 individuals with their weights (independent variable) and heights (dependent variable).

    "The assumptions of linear regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear, which means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable(s). This can be checked by plotting the data and examining scatter plots to assess if a linear relationship exists between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of errors: The errors (residuals) of the model should be independent, meaning that the value of the error for one observation should not depend on the value of the error for any other observation. This can be checked by examining residual plots and looking for any patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The errors should have constant variance, which means that the variance of the errors should be the same across all levels of the independent variable(s). This can be checked by examining residual plots and checking for a consistent spread of residuals across the range of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of errors: The errors should be normally distributed, meaning that they should follow a bell-shaped normal distribution. This can be checked by examining the distribution of residuals using histograms, Q-Q plots, or statistical tests for normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of predictors: The independent variables should be independent of each other, meaning that there should be no multicollinearity, which is a situation where two or more independent variables are highly correlated. This can be checked by calculating variance inflation factor (VIF) values for each independent variable, with VIF values greater than 10 indicating potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sample size: Linear regression performs well with large sample sizes, as it relies on the law of large numbers. While there is no strict threshold, a general rule of thumb is to have at least 20 observations per independent variable to ensure reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions can be checked using various statistical techniques such as residual plots, histograms, Q-Q plots, VIF calculations, and statistical tests for normality. If these assumptions are not met, it may indicate that linear regression is not appropriate for the data, and alternative regression methods or data transformations may need to be considered."

    "Multicollinearity refers to a situation in multiple linear regression where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, leading to problems in estimating the individual effects of these variables on the dependent variable. Multicollinearity can cause issues in interpreting the model coefficients, as it becomes difficult to determine the unique contribution of each independent variable to the dependent variable.\n",

    "Multicollinearity can cause several problems in a multiple linear regression model:\n",

This makes it difficult to interpret the importance and direction of the individual effects of the correlated variables on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss of statistical significance: Multicollinearity can also lead to loss of statistical significance of individual coefficients, even if the overall model is significant. This can result in misleading conclusions about the significance of individual predictors in the model.\n",

    "Combine correlated variables: Instead of removing correlated variables, another approach is to create a composite variable by combining them. For example, if two variables are highly correlated, their average or sum can be used as a single variable in the model.\n",

    "Use regularization techniques: Regularization techniques such as Ridge regression or Lasso regression can also be used to mitigate multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to the model that encourages the model to use fewer variables or shrink the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero.\n",

    "Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial function, instead of a straight line as in linear regression. It is a form of multiple regression, but instead of using multiple independent variables, it involves transforming a single independent variable into multiple polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial regression model is different from linear regression in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Degree of the polynomial: In linear regression, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear, meaning it can be represented by a straight line. However, in polynomial regression, the relationship can be modeled as a curve of varying degree (e.g., quadratic, cubic, etc.). The degree of the polynomial determines the flexibility and complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linearity: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, while polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships between variables. This allows polynomial regression to better fit data with curved patterns, where linear regression may not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "More predictors: In polynomial regression, additional predictors are added to the model to capture the polynomial terms. For example, if a polynomial regression model of degree 2 is used, then the model will include the original predictor(s), as well as the square of the predictor(s). This increases the number of predictors in the model compared to linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Polynomial regression models with higher degrees of polynomials can be prone to overfitting, which means the model may fit the training data very well but may not generalize well to new data. This is because higher degree polynomials can be too flexible and may capture noise in the data.\n",

    "Interpretation: Interpretation of the coefficients in polynomial regression can be more complex compared to linear regression. In linear regression, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the corresponding independent variable. In polynomial regression, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a unit change in the corresponding polynomial term, which can be more difficult to interpret.\n",
