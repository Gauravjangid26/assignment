    "Q5. To integrate the machine learning model with the user interface for the Algerian Forest Fires project, you can use APIs or libraries such as Flask, Django, or FastAPI. These frameworks allow you to build a RESTful API that exposes the machine learning model as a web service. The user interface can then interact with the API using HTTP requests and JSON data. The API can be hosted on a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform for scalability and reliability"
